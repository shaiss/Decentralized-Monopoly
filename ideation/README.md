# Ideation

Place raw notes, prior briefs, diagrams, links, and background materials here. Accepted formats: `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf` (summaries), images, and URLs in markdown.

The start orchestrator will:
- Synthesize objectives, scope, audience, constraints, and key claims
- Extract citations into `yellowpaper/context/references.md`
- Extract canonical terms into `yellowpaper/context/glossary.md`
- Propose/update `yellowpaper/outline.md`

Keep sources explicit. Prefer linking to primary references.
