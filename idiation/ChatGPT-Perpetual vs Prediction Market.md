## Prompt:
I'm thinking of a blockchain project. It's a perpetual market where a stablecoin is pegged to the price of a show like a new Jordan shoe.   Ppl can then by futures contracts to bet if the price of the shoe will go up or down.   I don't think  this this would be a prediction market. Although it could.  So what make more sense. A perpetual shoe market or a shoe prediction market

## Response:
Great question — what you’re describing sits at the intersection of **perpetual futures markets** and **prediction markets**, but they’re not exactly the same. Let’s break this down:

* * *

🔹 Perpetual Shoe Market
------------------------

*   **How it works**: You create a synthetic asset (a stablecoin or token) that tracks the price of, say, a new Air Jordan release. Traders can long or short it using perpetual futures.
*   **Mechanics**:
    *   Needs an oracle to track the _real-world shoe price_ (resale market data, StockX, GOAT, eBay).
    *   Uses funding rates (like crypto perps) to keep the futures price close to the underlying index.
    *   The market outcome is **continuous** — prices move daily/hourly, and traders adjust positions.
*   **Analogy**: This is like a perpetual futures contract on gold, oil, or Bitcoin, but here the underlying is “Air Jordan resale price.”
*   **Use case**: People who want to hedge or speculate on the sneaker market, without actually owning shoes.

* * *

🔹 Shoe Prediction Market
-------------------------

*   **How it works**: Instead of continuous pricing, you define **specific future events** with binary or categorical outcomes. For example:
    *   “Will the resale price of Jordan X exceed $500 by December 1?”
    *   “Which price bracket will Jordan X fall into within 6 months?”
*   **Mechanics**:
    *   Traders buy shares in outcomes (yes/no, or different brackets).
    *   Once the event resolves, winners get paid, losers don’t.
*   **Analogy**: Like Polymarket or Augur, but for sneaker outcomes.
*   **Use case**: Captures **discrete predictions** rather than continuous trading. Great for one-off launches or drops.

* * *

🔹 Key Differences
------------------

| Feature | Perpetual Market | Prediction Market |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Type of bet** | Continuous price speculation | Binary / categorical outcomes |
| **Time horizon** | Ongoing, no expiry | Ends at resolution date |
| **Liquidity style** | Needs AMM or order book | LMSR / AMM-style pools |
| **Audience** | Traders, hedge funds, sneaker speculators | Gamblers, forecasters, sneakerheads guessing launch hype |

* * *

🔹 Which Makes More Sense?
--------------------------

*   **Perpetual Shoe Market**: Better if you want _ongoing speculation_ tied to real-world resale prices. This mimics financial markets and may attract traders who already use perps in crypto.
*   **Shoe Prediction Market**: Better if you want to capture _specific events_ (like drop-day hype or whether resale will beat retail by 2x). This is simpler, more gamified, and resonates with sneakerheads making bets.

* * *

👉 My take: If you’re targeting **sneaker traders / flippers**, a **perpetual market** is more compelling (since they already think in terms of price moves). But if you’re targeting **casual sneakerheads / fans**, a **prediction market** might be easier for them to understand and more fun.

* * *

Do you want me to sketch how the **tokenomics and oracle design** could look for each option (so you can compare feasibility)?

## Prompt:
Continue the comparison

## Response:
Perfect — let’s dive deeper into the **comparison** and get more concrete around **mechanics, tokenomics, oracles, and audience fit**.

* * *

⚙️ Core Mechanics
-----------------

### **Perpetual Shoe Market**

*   **Index Price Source**: Needs a _trusted oracle_ that tracks sneaker resale prices (e.g., StockX average sale price for Jordan 1 Retro High “Chicago”).
*   **Funding Rate**: Keeps perp price close to index, incentivizing longs/shorts to balance.
*   **Market Structure**:
    *   Continuous trading, like BTC perps.
    *   No expiry — positions can be held indefinitely.
    *   Margin & leverage possible.

### **Shoe Prediction Market**

*   **Event Resolution**: Each market is tied to a clear question, e.g., _“Will Jordan 4 Retro sell for > $400 by December 2025?”_.
*   **Oracles**: Don’t need real-time feeds — only need resolution at the end date.
*   **Market Structure**:
    *   Binary (Yes/No) or multiple outcomes.
    *   Runs until event closes.
    *   Payouts only at resolution.

* * *

💰 Tokenomics & Incentives
--------------------------

### **Perpetual Shoe Market**

*   **Liquidity Providers**: Supply collateral into AMMs or order books, earn fees.
*   **Traders**: Pay funding rate if off balance, can go leveraged long/short.
*   **Native Token** (optional): Could be used for staking, governance, and LP incentives.
*   **Sustainability**: Needs a healthy balance of longs vs shorts; otherwise, funding can be lopsided.

### **Shoe Prediction Market**

*   **Liquidity Providers**: Provide initial liquidity to outcome pools, earn trading fees.
*   **Traders**: Buy shares of outcomes (like “Yes” or “No”).
*   **Native Token**: Often used for governance or dispute resolution (like REP in Augur).
*   **Sustainability**: Liquidity naturally winds down after event resolution. New markets must be spun up continuously.

* * *

🔮 Oracle Design
----------------

### **Perpetual Shoe Market**

*   **Challenge**: Needs a trusted, manipulable-resistant feed for shoe prices.
*   **Options**:
    *   Scrape + average prices from StockX, GOAT, eBay, Stadium Goods.
    *   Use a decentralized oracle network to aggregate.
*   **Problem**: Sneaker prices are **less liquid** than assets like gold/crypto — data may be thin and volatile.

### **Shoe Prediction Market**

*   **Challenge**: Must define _exact resolution conditions_ (e.g., “Will StockX average sale price exceed $500 between Dec 1–Dec 31?”).
*   **Options**:
    *   Simple single-source (StockX closing average).
    *   Community arbitration (optimistic oracle like UMA).
*   **Problem**: Requires _clear resolution criteria_ to avoid disputes.

* * *

👥 Audience Fit
---------------

### **Perpetual Shoe Market**

*   **Target Users**:
    *   Crypto traders familiar with perps.
    *   Sneaker investors looking for price exposure without owning inventory.
*   **Appeal**: Feels like _finance meets culture_. Fits into broader “synthetic assets” thesis.
*   **Barrier**: Complex mechanics (funding rates, leverage) may intimidate casual sneakerheads.

### **Shoe Prediction Market**

*   **Target Users**:
    *   Casual sneakerheads, hypebeasts, gamblers.
    *   People who want to “bet with friends” on sneaker drops.
*   **Appeal**: Simple — “Yes or No.” Very social.
*   **Barrier**: Each market is short-lived; liquidity may fragment across many events.

* * *

📊 Comparative Snapshot
-----------------------

| Feature | Perpetual Shoe Market | Shoe Prediction Market |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Market Style** | Continuous, no expiry | One-off, event-based |
| **Oracle Needs** | Real-time, continuous | End-date resolution |
| **Liquidity Model** | Ongoing | Market closes after event |
| **Audience** | Traders & investors | Fans & gamblers |
| **Complexity** | Higher (funding, leverage) | Lower (binary bets) |
| **Longevity** | Evergreen (can run indefinitely) | Event-limited |
| **Cultural Fit** | Finance + sneaker economy | Social betting + sneaker hype |

* * *

⚖️ Which Is Better?
-------------------

*   **If your goal is financial innovation** → **Perpetual Shoe Market** (a sneaker “derivatives exchange”).
*   **If your goal is mass adoption & engagement** → **Prediction Market** (fun sneaker bets, viral engagement).

* * *

👉 Next step: I can sketch **concrete product flows** (UX journeys) for each idea — like how a user would onboard, trade, and cash out. That could help visualize _which feels more compelling in practice_.

Want me to draft that comparison too?

## Prompt:
Let's focus on the shoe perps.   Let's dive in with what's required from my side as the founder that's non tech related.  Is do I need to bring liquidity?  What happens if the markets are lopsided and how do we address that.  How does the buying of perp contracts work. I understand ppl short or long on the resell price. But there's more to it.

## Response:
Got it — let’s zoom in on **shoe perpetuals** and think like a founder/operator rather than an engineer. You’re essentially building a **specialized derivatives exchange** around sneaker prices. Let’s break it into **your responsibilities**, **market mechanics**, and **risk/lopsided liquidity management**.

* * *

👔 Your Role as Founder (Non-Technical Side)
--------------------------------------------

1.  **Liquidity Strategy**
    *   Yes, you _do_ need to bootstrap liquidity. Perps rely on **counterparties** — every long needs a short.
    *   To get early traction, you’ll likely need:
        *   **Seed LPs** (early backers, funds, or even sneaker resellers who want exposure).
        *   **Incentives** (fee rebates, token rewards, or yield for liquidity providers).
        *   **Market Makers** (professional firms who can keep the order book balanced).
2.  **Index Curation**
    *   You need to **decide which sneakers to list**. Not all shoes have liquid resale markets. Start with iconic ones (e.g., Jordan 1 Chicago, Yeezy 350 OG, Travis Scott collabs).
    *   Define _how the price index is calculated_ (daily VWAP on StockX? 7-day moving average?). Transparency here builds trust.
3.  **Community & Culture**
    *   Traders alone won’t sustain this — you’re tapping into **sneakerhead culture**. That means:
        *   Partnerships with sneaker influencers.
        *   Gamified UX (leaderboards, trading competitions).
        *   Onboarding sneaker fans who aren’t crypto-native.
4.  **Compliance / Legal Wrapper**
    *   This is effectively a **derivatives exchange**, which in TradFi is regulated heavily.
    *   You’ll need to explore offshore structures, “synthetic asset” framing, or even lean toward prediction-market framing if targeting U.S. users.

* * *

⚙️ How Buying Perp Contracts Actually Works
-------------------------------------------

Most traders don’t realize perps are not like buying a stock or even a sneaker — they’re **a bet against other traders, balanced by funding rates**.

1.  **Trader Goes Long (bullish)**
    *   Deposits collateral (say $100 USDC).
    *   Buys $500 worth of “Jordan 1 perp” long exposure at 5x leverage.
    *   If the shoe price index rises, their PnL grows; if it falls, collateral is at risk.
2.  **Trader Goes Short (bearish)**
    *   Same process, but betting resale price goes down.
    *   Shorts need to _borrow synthetic exposure_ — meaning they’re selling contracts that don’t exist until someone goes long.
3.  **Funding Rate Mechanism**
    *   If longs greatly outnumber shorts, the perp contract trades above the index price.
    *   A **funding fee** kicks in — longs pay shorts periodically to incentivize shorts to step in.
    *   This is how markets self-correct.
4.  **Closing Position**
    *   Traders can close anytime by taking the opposite trade.
    *   No expiry means these markets run indefinitely, unlike futures.

* * *

⚖️ Lopsided Market Risk
-----------------------

*   **Problem**: What if _everyone_ is bullish (likely for hyped sneaker drops)?
    *   Perp price drifts above the index → huge funding rates.
    *   If no shorts step in, traders bleed fees and liquidity dries up.
*   **Solutions**:
    1.  **Attract Pro Market Makers**: They don’t care about sneaker hype; they profit from spreads and funding.
    2.  **LP Vaults**: Users can deposit USDC into vaults that act as passive counterparties (like dYdX’s insurance fund).
    3.  **Token Incentives**: Reward shorts when the market is one-sided to restore balance.
    4.  **Dynamic Funding**: Aggressively adjust funding rates to pull liquidity back into balance.

* * *

🛠️ Beyond Just Long/Short
--------------------------

You’re right — there’s more than just betting up/down:

*   **Leverage**: Traders can 2x, 5x, 10x their positions.
*   **Hedging**: Sneaker resellers could short perps to hedge inventory risk (if they’re sitting on 50 pairs and fear price drop).
*   **Arbitrage**: Pro traders might arb sneaker perp vs actual resale market price discrepancies.
*   **Structured Products**: You could later build sneaker “indexes” (top 10 Jordans) or even ETFs of hype shoes.

* * *

✅ **Big takeaway for you as founder**:  
Your main non-technical job is **seeding liquidity and culture**. Without counterparties, perps don’t work. Without sneakerhead buy-in, it’s just another DeFi perp exchange.

* * *

Would you like me to **map out a launch strategy** — like what you need for **Day 1 (MVP market launch)** in terms of liquidity, users, and partnerships? That might help you see how to go from idea → first tradable market.

## Prompt:
Explain the seeding liquidity

## Response:
Great — let’s go deeper into **liquidity seeding** for your **shoe perpetuals exchange**. This is _the_ hardest non-technical part of building a perp protocol, because if there’s no depth in the order book (or AMM pool), traders won’t touch it.

* * *

🔹 Why Liquidity Matters
------------------------

*   Perps are **zero-sum**: every long needs a short.
*   If markets are shallow, spreads widen, funding gets crazy, and traders churn out.
*   Your job is to make sure early users can always open/close positions smoothly.

* * *

🔹 Sources of Seed Liquidity
----------------------------

### 1\. **Professional Market Makers**

*   Firms (like Wintermute, GSR, or sneaker-native hedge groups) can provide depth.
*   They profit from:
    *   Bid/ask spreads.
    *   Funding arbitrage (taking the unpopular side and collecting payments).
*   **Your role**:
    *   Negotiate agreements (liquidity as a service).
    *   Offer fee rebates or token incentives.

* * *

### 2\. **Liquidity Provider Vaults (DeFi-style)**

*   Users deposit USDC (or stablecoin) into a vault.
*   The vault acts as the **counterparty** to traders automatically.
*   When traders lose, LPs win, and vice versa.
*   Example: dYdX uses an insurance fund to protect LPs; GMX has “GLP” where LPs take the other side of trades.
*   **Your role**:
    *   Design tokenomics (LPs earn trading fees + yield).
    *   Market this as **“Earn yield on sneaker markets”** to DeFi users.

* * *

### 3\. **Sneaker Resellers as Liquidity**

*   Unique to your niche: real-world sneaker resellers already hold inventory and **care about hedging**.
*   Example: A reseller holding 100 pairs of Jordan 1 Chicagos can short your perp market to lock in resale value.
*   **Your role**:
    *   Partner with sneaker shops or high-volume resellers.
    *   Pitch it as “insurance” against price drops.

* * *

### 4\. **Your Own Treasury (Founder Capital)**

*   At the very start, you may need to inject liquidity yourself (or through your investors).
*   This ensures _Day 1 markets_ don’t feel empty.
*   **Your role**:
    *   Allocate capital strategically to the first few pairs.
    *   Slowly phase it out once user LPs and MMs step in.

* * *

🔹 Handling Lopsided Markets
----------------------------

This is critical, because sneaker hype will often skew bullish. Here’s how liquidity seeding helps:

*   **Market Makers**: Step in on the short side when retail is overly long.
*   **Funding Rates**: Built-in mechanism forces longs to pay shorts → encourages balance.
*   **Token Incentives**: If funding isn’t enough, you can bribe one side (e.g., reward short positions with governance tokens).
*   **Vaults**: Automatically absorb flow, so you don’t need perfect symmetry at all times.

* * *

🔹 Your Action Plan (Non-Tech)
------------------------------

1.  **Day 1 Liquidity Design**
    *   Decide: order book (needs pro MMs) vs AMM-style (needs LP vault).
    *   Lock in agreements with at least 1–2 market makers.
2.  **Capital Commitment**
    *   Secure initial seed liquidity (from you + investors).
    *   Plan for $1–5M if you want serious traction, or start smaller ($100k–500k per shoe market) to test.
3.  **Partnerships**
    *   Court sneaker resellers as natural hedgers.
    *   Position your product as “the risk management tool for sneaker entrepreneurs.”
4.  **User Incentives**
    *   Design yield for LPs: trading fees, token rewards, maybe even “sneaker points” gamification.
    *   Make it clear: providing liquidity isn’t gambling — it’s yield farming sneaker hype.

* * *

✅ **In short**: As founder, _yes you need to bring liquidity_ (via MMs, LPs, resellers, or treasury). The key is to **bootstrap until network effects kick in** — once sneaker traders see enough depth, they’ll generate the volume that sustains LPs and market makers.

* * *

Would you like me to break down **exactly how much liquidity you’d need** to launch the **first sneaker market** (say for a Jordan 1 drop) and what roles that liquidity would play? That way you’ll see the scale of commitment.

## Prompt:
Can we use dydx and copy their mechanics

## Response:
Yes — you can absolutely **model your shoe perps after dYdX**. In fact, dYdX is the **gold standard** for perpetual futures exchanges, and a lot of what they built can be adapted to your sneaker market. The trick is knowing **what to copy directly** vs **what you’ll need to tweak** for your niche.

* * *

🔹 Core Mechanics from dYdX You Can Copy
----------------------------------------

1.  **Perpetual Futures Engine**
    *   Continuous contracts with **no expiry**.
    *   Positions opened with **collateralized margin** (e.g., USDC).
    *   **PnL settles in USDC**, not in the sneaker token itself.
2.  **Funding Rate System**
    *   Balances perp price with index (sneaker resale index).
    *   If longs > shorts → longs pay shorts.
    *   If shorts > longs → shorts pay longs.
3.  **Order Book Model** (if you choose it)
    *   Professional market makers keep spreads tight.
    *   Best for high-volume traders.
    *   dYdX incentivizes MMs with rebates + token rewards.
4.  **Risk Management**
    *   Cross-margin: one margin account covers multiple markets.
    *   Insurance fund: covers bankruptcies if a trader can’t pay losses.
    *   Liquidation engine: closes positions when collateral ratio breaks limits.
5.  **Governance Token Model** (DYDX token)
    *   Incentivizes early traders + LPs.
    *   Provides fee discounts, voting rights.
    *   Attracts both retail and DeFi whales.

* * *

🔹 What You’ll Need to Adapt for Sneakers
-----------------------------------------

1.  **Price Index (Oracle)**
    *   This is your biggest divergence from dYdX.
    *   Crypto perps use liquid exchange prices; you’ll need to **construct a sneaker price index** from StockX, GOAT, eBay, etc.
    *   Solution:
        *   Use a VWAP (volume-weighted average price).
        *   Smooth data with moving averages to prevent manipulation.
        *   Consider an **optimistic oracle** (like UMA) for dispute resolution.
2.  **Market Listings**
    *   dYdX lists ETH, BTC, SOL, etc. — highly liquid assets.
    *   You’ll need to carefully curate sneaker listings:
        *   Only include shoes with proven secondary market liquidity.
        *   Start small (1–3 iconic pairs), then expand.
3.  **Liquidity Seeding**
    *   dYdX attracts institutional MMs — you may not have that leverage at first.
    *   You’ll need to **bootstrap with vaults** (like GMX’s GLP) or sneaker-reseller partnerships.
4.  **Community Angle**
    *   dYdX targets pro traders; you’ll need to **blend finance + sneaker culture**.
    *   More gamification, influencer partnerships, and sneakerhead UX.

* * *

🔹 Copy-Paste vs Innovate
-------------------------

| Component | Copy dYdX | Adapt for Sneakers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Perp contract mechanics** | ✅ Yes | — |
| **Funding rates** | ✅ Yes | — |
| **Collateral model** | ✅ Yes (USDC stablecoin) | — |
| **Risk/liquidation engine** | ✅ Yes | — |
| **Tokenomics** | ✅ Yes (trading rewards + governance) | Add sneaker flavor |
| **Oracles** | ❌ No (crypto feeds) | Build sneaker price feeds |
| **Liquidity sourcing** | ❌ No (institutional MMs only) | Mix pro MMs + LP vaults + sneaker resellers |
| **Community focus** | ❌ No (pro traders) | Sneakerhead + DeFi crossover |

* * *

🔹 Big Picture
--------------

👉 **Yes, copy dYdX’s mechanics** — they’ve already solved the perp model elegantly.  
👉 Your **edge** is not technical mechanics, but:

*   Building a **reliable sneaker oracle**.
*   Seeding liquidity in a **low-liquidity niche asset**.
*   Merging **sneaker culture with DeFi mechanics** (gamification, partnerships).

* * *

✅ **So as founder, you don’t need to reinvent the perp engine — just “skin it” for sneakers and solve the unique price/liquidity challenges.**

* * *

Would it help if I **mapped your shoe perps to GMX’s AMM model** too (instead of order book like dYdX)? That way you can see the pros/cons of each approach for a niche asset with thinner liquidity.

## Prompt:
Anything we can barrow from frax mechanics to improve our design?

## Response:
🔥 Great angle. Frax is one of the most innovative protocols in DeFi because it **blends collateral models, incentives, and stability mechanisms** in ways that can be borrowed outside of stablecoins. For your **sneaker perps**, there are definitely some ideas you can **steal/adapt from Frax** to make your design more resilient and attractive.

* * *

🔹 Quick Refresher on Frax Mechanics
------------------------------------

Frax is built around 3 main ideas:

1.  **Fractional Collateralization**
    *   FRAX stablecoin is partly backed by hard collateral (USDC, ETH) and partly by algorithmic governance token (FXS).
    *   This makes it **capital efficient** vs fully collateralized stablecoins.
2.  **Algorithmic Incentives**
    *   When FRAX deviates from $1, arbitrageurs use mint/redeem mechanisms to restore the peg.
    *   Stability comes from **market forces**, not just backing.
3.  **Flywheel Tokenomics**
    *   FXS (the governance token) accrues value from usage, fees, and collateral ratio adjustments.
    *   LP incentives keep liquidity deep across Curve, Uniswap, etc.

* * *

🔹 Borrowing for Sneaker Perps
------------------------------

Here’s how you could adapt Frax-style mechanics to your sneaker perp design:

* * *

### 1\. **Fractional Collateralized Vaults** (Frax → Shoe LPs)

*   Instead of requiring **fully collateralized LP vaults**, you can let vaults be **partially collateralized**.
*   Example:
    *   LP vaults backstop trades with 70% USDC collateral.
    *   30% is synthetic exposure (minted governance token).
*   Why this helps:
    *   Capital efficiency → you don’t need massive USDC reserves.
    *   Governance token demand scales as markets grow.

* * *

### 2\. **Arbitrage-Stabilized Index Peg** (Frax peg → Sneaker index)

*   Frax uses mint/redeem arbitrage to keep $FRAX = $1.
*   You could design an **arbitrage loop** to keep your sneaker perp index aligned:
    *   If perp price > sneaker index → incentivize shorts (just like Frax pushes mint pressure).
    *   If perp price < sneaker index → incentivize longs (like Frax redeem pressure).
*   This could be **augmented by synthetic sneaker tokens** (e.g., sJordan1) minted/redeemed against vaults.

* * *

### 3\. **Governance Token Flywheel** (FXS → Sneaker Token)

*   Your governance token can work like FXS:
    *   **Capture fees** from perp trading (funding fees, liquidation fees).
    *   **Boost LP yields** (staking LP tokens earns governance rewards).
    *   **Control collateral ratios** (governance adjusts vault collateralization as system matures).
*   Result: the more sneaker perp volume grows, the more valuable your governance token becomes → a positive flywheel.

* * *

### 4\. **Dual Token System** (FRAX + FXS → Sneaker Stable + Sneaker Gov Token)

*   You could mirror Frax’s **two-token model**:
    1.  **Stable unit** (e.g., `sUSD` or `sNEAK`) → used for settlement inside the perp system.
    2.  **Governance/utility token** (e.g., `KICKS`) → accrues value from fees, used for incentives.
*   Why: Separates **trader needs (stability)** from **protocol needs (value accrual)**.

* * *

### 5\. **Curve-Style Liquidity Partnerships** (Frax’s Curve dominance → Sneaker LP dominance)

*   Frax is famous for **Curve wars** — bribing liquidity into FRAX pools.
*   You could adopt a **liquidity bribing system**:
    *   LPs who stake into sneaker perp vaults get boosted rewards.
    *   Governance token holders vote on **which sneaker markets** get boosted (e.g., Jordan 1s vs Yeezys).
*   This creates a **meta-game around liquidity allocation**.

* * *

🔹 Example: Sneaker Perp x Frax Hybrid
--------------------------------------

Imagine you launch:

*   **sNEAK** → a sneaker-index stablecoin pegged to $1 of sneaker market exposure.
*   **KICKS** → your governance token.

**How it works:**

*   Traders deposit USDC to mint `sNEAK` and use it to margin trade sneaker perps.
*   Liquidity vaults are 80% USDC + 20% KICKS.
*   Perp fees (funding + liquidation) are paid in USDC but partially used to buyback `KICKS`.
*   Governance adjusts collateral ratio as the market matures.

Result: You get **Frax-style reflexivity** → more sneaker trading → more fees → higher KICKS demand → stronger vaults → more sneaker trading.

* * *

🔹 What Frax Gives You That dYdX Doesn’t
----------------------------------------

*   **Capital efficiency** → you don’t need insane amounts of USDC backing.
*   **Reflexive tokenomics** → your governance token gets real demand hooks.
*   **Liquidity flywheel** → you can bribe and direct liquidity where it’s needed most.

* * *

✅ **So yes — you should copy dYdX for the _trading mechanics_ and borrow Frax for the _liquidity & tokenomics layer_.** That combo is powerful: dYdX’s exchange engine + Frax’s capital-efficient liquidity design.

* * *

Would you like me to **sketch a hybrid model** (DYDX mechanics + FRAX tokenomics) for your shoe perp exchange — like a concrete system diagram of how the tokens, vaults, and fees flow?

1\. Abstract
------------

SPEX is a decentralized derivatives protocol that lists **perpetual futures** on individual sneaker SKUs (e.g., “Jordan 1 Retro High ‘Chicago’ 2015”). Contracts are USD‑settled and reference a robust **Sneaker Price Index (SPI)** built from multiple secondary market sources.

The exchange combines:

*   **dYdX‑style perp mechanics:** margining, funding, mark/index prices, liquidations, insurance.
*   **Frax‑style capital efficiency:** a two‑token model with a partially collateralized internal stable unit and a governance token that directs incentives to markets and liquidity.

Participants include **traders**, **professional market makers (MMs)**, **LP vault depositors**, and **real‑world sneaker resellers** who hedge inventory. Governance curates listings and risk parameters.

* * *

2\. Design Goals
----------------

1.  **Accurate Exposure:** Track resale prices of specific sneaker SKUs with low basis risk.
2.  **Continuous Liquidity:** Allow leveraged long/short positions with tight spreads and predictable funding.
3.  **Oracle Robustness:** Aggregate multiple sources; resist manipulation; handle staleness and outliers.
4.  **Capital Efficiency:** Use a Frax‑inspired model to reduce pure stable collateral needs while preserving safety.
5.  **Safety First:** Conservative risk engine, circuit breakers, insurance fund, and ADL as last resort.
6.  **Cultural Fit:** Enable hedging for resellers; make speculation accessible to sneaker communities.

* * *

3\. System Overview
-------------------

### 3.1 Tokens

*   **sNEAK (stable unit):** USD‑pegged internal settlement unit, **partially collateralized** (e.g., ≥ 80% exogenous stable collateral; remainder reflexive via KICKS).
*   **KICKS (governance/utility):** Receives protocol value (buybacks/fees), grants **veKICKS** voting power when locked, directs emissions to selected markets (gauge model).

> Note: USD settlement is chosen for trader familiarity and risk clarity. Underlyings (sneakers) are priced in USD.

### 3.2 Core Modules

*   **Perp Engine:** order book (or hybrid) matching, margining, funding, PnL, liquidation, insurance, ADL.
*   **Oracle Module:** multi‑source SPI per SKU + smoothing + outlier clipping + optimistic dispute.
*   **Liquidity Module:** LP Vault(s) that warehouse inventory risk and provide backstop liquidity; market maker incentives.
*   **Governance:** parameter management, listings, collateral ratio (CR) policy, incentive gauges, emergency controls.

* * *

4\. Notation
------------

*    $i$ : market (SKU).
*    $P_i(t)$ : **Index price** (SPI) in USD.
*    $M_i(t)$ : **Mark price** used for margin/funding (smoothed/trade‑aware).
*    $S_i(t)$ : **Spot proxy** (recent trades mid) for sanity checks.
*    $Q$ : position size (positive = long, negative = short), in **contract units** whose notional is  $|Q| \cdot P_i(t)$ .
*    $E$ : account equity (USD).
*    $IMR_i$ : initial margin ratio;  $MMR_i$ : maintenance margin ratio.
*    $\text{OI}^{L/R}_i$ : long/short open interest (USD notional).
*    $\text{skew}_i = \text{OI}^L_i - \text{OI}^S_i$ ;  $\text{OI}_i = \text{OI}^L_i + \text{OI}^S_i$ .
*   Funding period  $\Delta_f$  (e.g., 1 hour).
*   Funding coefficients  $\alpha_i, \beta_i$ ; cap  $\gamma_i$ .
*   **clamp** $x,a,b$  = min(max(x,a),b).

* * *

5\. Oracle: Sneaker Price Index (SPI)
-------------------------------------

Each market  $i$  references a SKU defined by a canonical **Sneaker Product ID (SPID)** (brand, model, colorway, year, condition = _deadstock/DS_).

### 5.1 Data Sources

Let  $\mathcal{S}$  be sources (e.g., StockX, GOAT, eBay, major boutiques with public sale records). For each source  $s \in \mathcal{S}$ :

*   Collect last  $N$  trades and volumes over lookback window  $W$  (e.g., 7 days).
*   Compute source VWAP  $\hat{p}_{s,i}$  and trade count  $n_{s,i}$ .

### 5.2 Cleaning & Eligibility

*   Discard sources with  $n_{s,i} < n_{\min}$ .
*   Apply **trimmed statistics** (e.g., remove top/bottom  $\tau$ % price outliers at source level).
*   Optional **condition filter**: only DS; exclude sizes outside liquid range; normalize by size curve if needed.

### 5.3 Aggregation

*   **Weighted median‑of‑means**:
    1.  Partition cleaned trades per source into k blocks, compute block means; take source median  $m_{s,i}$ .
    2.  Assign weights  $w_s \propto \log(1 + n_{s,i}) \cdot r_s$ , with  $r_s$  a reliability score in  $[0,1]$ .
    3.  Raw index  $P^\*_{i} = \frac{\sum_s w_s \, m_{s,i}}{\sum_s w_s}$ .

### 5.4 Smoothing & Staleness

*   **EWM smoothing:**  
     $P_i(t) = \lambda P_i(t-\Delta) + (1-\lambda) P^\*_{i}(t)$ , with half‑life  $h \Rightarrow \lambda=2^{-\Delta/h}$ .
*   **Staleness:** if no eligible update for  $T_{\text{stale}}$ , freeze funding, widen bands, or switch to **optimistic oracle** (UMA‑like): proposer posts  $P$ , disputers can challenge within window  $\Delta_d$ ; resolve via bonded arbitration.

### 5.5 Price Bands & Circuit Breakers

*   Hard band: reject updates where  $|P^\*_i - P_i|/P_i > b_{\max}$  unless verified by multiple sources.
*   **Kill switch:** governance‑controlled global pause if oracle integrity compromised.

* * *

6\. Mark Price, Funding, and PnL
--------------------------------

### 6.1 Mark Price

Define a liquidity‑aware mark:

$$
M_i(t) = \theta \cdot P_i(t) + (1-\theta)\cdot \tilde{T}_i(t)
$$

where  $\tilde{T}_i(t)$  is an order‑book microprice or last trade mid, smoothed;  $\theta \in [0.5, 0.9]$ .

### 6.2 Funding Rate

Funding aligns  $M_i$  with  $P_i$  and balances **skew** (one‑sided OI).

Per‑period funding rate (paid _from longs to shorts_ when positive):

$$
f_i = \text{clamp}\!\left(\alpha_i \cdot \frac{M_i - P_i}{P_i} \;+\; \beta_i \cdot \frac{\text{skew}_i}{\max(\text{OI}_i, \epsilon)}, \; -\gamma_i,\; \gamma_i\right)
$$
*   **Basis term**  $\alpha_i \frac{M-P}{P}$  mirrors dYdX.
*   **Skew term**  $\beta_i \frac{\text{skew}}{\text{OI}}$  (Frax‑inspired balancing) explicitly incentivizes the short/long minority.
*   Cap  $\gamma_i$  prevents runaway funding.

**Payment per position** over one funding interval  $\Delta_f$ :

$$
\text{funding\_payment} = Q \cdot M_i \cdot f_i
$$

(Longs pay when  $f_i>0$ ; shorts pay when  $f_i<0$ .)

**Worked example (step‑by‑step):**

*   Suppose  $P_i = 400$  and  $M_i = 408$ . The premium is  $408 - 400 = 8$ . Divide by index:  $8 / 400 = 0.02$  (2%).
*   Let  $\alpha_i = 0.50$  per day; basis term =  $0.50 \times 0.02 = 0.01$  (1%/day).
*   Let  $\text{OI}^L = 3{,}000{,}000$ ,  $\text{OI}^S = 1{,}000{,}000$ . Then  $\text{skew} = 2{,}000{,}000$ . Total  $\text{OI} = 4{,}000{,}000$ . Skew ratio  $= 2{,}000{,}000 / 4{,}000{,}000 = 0.5$ .
*   Let  $\beta_i = 0.20$  per day; skew term  $= 0.20 \times 0.5 = 0.10$  (10%/day).
*   Uncapped daily funding  $= 0.01 + 0.10 = 0.11$  (11%/day).
*   If  $\gamma_i = 0.35$ /day, no cap applies.
*   Hourly funding  $= 0.11 / 24$ . Compute:  $11 \div 24 = 0.458333…\%$  per hour.
*   A long with  $Q \cdot M_i = \$5{,}000$  notional pays  $0.00458333 \times 5{,}000 = 22.91665$  ≈ **$22.92 per hour**.

_(Parameterization should avoid extreme funding in production; example is deliberately illustrative.)_

### 6.3 PnL

Unrealized PnL:

$$
\text{uPnL} = Q \cdot (M_i - \text{entry\_price})
$$

Realized PnL accrues on trade execution.

Account equity:

$$
E = \text{balance}_{\text{sNEAK}} + \sum_i \text{uPnL}_i - \text{fees} - \text{funding\_owed} + \text{funding\_received}
$$

* * *

7\. Margining and Liquidations
------------------------------

### 7.1 Margin Requirements

For position with notional  $N = |Q| \cdot M_i$ :

*   **Initial Margin (IM):**  $\text{IM} = IMR_i \cdot N$ 
*   **Maintenance Margin (MM):**  $\text{MM} = MMR_i \cdot N$ 

Free collateral  $\text{FC} = E - \sum_i \text{IM}_i$ .  
If  $E < \sum_i \text{MM}_i$  → **eligible for liquidation**.

Typical starting values (to be calibrated):

*    $IMR_i \in [5\%, 15\%]$  depending on SKU liquidity.
*    $MMR_i = 0.5 \cdot IMR_i$  to  $0.8 \cdot IMR_i$ .

### 7.2 Liquidation Process

*   **Trigger:**  $E < \sum \text{MM}$ .
*   **Executor:** Liquidator closes part/all of the position at **bankruptcy price** with a **penalty**  $\phi_i$  (e.g., 50–150 bps of notional) that feeds the **insurance fund** plus liquidator bounty.
*   **Partial liquidation:** reduce to safe margin; full liquidation if equity insufficient.

### 7.3 Insurance Fund & ADL

*   **Insurance Fund:** Capitalized by protocol fees and explicit allocations; covers **bad debt** when liquidation slippage exceeds collateral.
*   **Auto‑Deleveraging (ADL):** If insurance exhausted in a SKU, system cancels maker quotes and auto‑reduces positions starting with the **highest leverage, highest profit** contra‑party side. ADL events are reported and incentivize re‑capitalization.

* * *

8\. Market Microstructure
-------------------------

### 8.1 Order Book + RFQ (recommended)

*   Central limit order book (CLOB) with professional MMs (tight spreads).
*   RFQ for large blocks; quotes must respect **mark bands** relative to  $M_i$ .
*   Maker rebates; taker fees.

### 8.2 Alternative: LP vAMM Backstop

*   LP Vault can provide **backstop liquidity** via a bounded‑range vAMM with inventory/price‑impact controls; primarily active during thin order book periods.

* * *

9\. Liquidity & Capital Model (Frax‑Inspired)
---------------------------------------------

### 9.1 sNEAK (USD‑settled internal unit)

*   **Peg target:** $1.00.
*   **Backing:**
    *   Exogenous stable collateral (USDC/USDT/DAI) share  $c_t$  (e.g., ≥ 80%).
    *   Reflexive backing via **KICKS** share  $1 - c_t$  (algorithmically adjustable).
*   **Mint/Redeem:**
    *   Mint sNEAK by depositing collateral per current CR  $c_t$  + small KICKS burn if  $c_t < 1$ .
    *   Redeem sNEAK for collateral; redemption fees adjust with peg deviations.

**Collateral Ratio Policy:**  
Governance (or controller) targets  $c_t$  based on **market stress** and sNEAK premium/discount. Example controller:

$$
c_{t+1} = \text{clamp}\!\left(c_t + \eta \cdot (\text{peg\_error}) + \zeta \cdot \text{VaR\_stress},\; c_{\min},\; 1\right)
$$

where  $\text{peg\_error} = 1 - \text{sNEAK\_price}$ ,  $\text{VaR\_stress}$  is a function of realized perp volatility and LP drawdowns.

### 9.2 LP Vaults

*   LPs deposit sNEAK (or base collateral) into **SKU‑agnostic** or **SKU‑specific** vaults.
*   Vaults earn: taker fees share, spread capture (if backstop quoting), funding residuals, liquidation fees share, and **KICKS emissions**.
*   Vault risk managed by:
    *   **Inventory caps:**  $\text{OI}_i \leq \kappa_i \cdot \text{Vault\_Equity}$ .
    *   **Delta/vega limits:** vault cannot be forced into extreme skew; quotes widen as skew grows.
    *   **Stress loss buffers** and dynamic CR.

### 9.3 MMs and Bribing (Gauge Model)

*   Lock KICKS → **veKICKS** voting.
*   Markets receive variable KICKS emissions per epoch based on veKICKS votes (Curve/Frax model).
*   Founders/partners can **bribe** veKICKS voters to direct emissions to target SKUs (e.g., new drop).

* * *

10\. Fees and Value Flow
------------------------

*   **Trading fees:** maker rebate  $r_m$ , taker fee  $f_t$  (e.g., 0–2 bps / 5–10 bps).
*   **Funding:** flows between longs/shorts; protocol may skim a tiny share  $\upsilon$  (e.g., 5% of net).
*   **Liquidation fee:**  $\phi_i$  → split between liquidator and insurance.
*   **Protocol allocation:** portion of fees → **insurance**, **sNEAK peg defense**, **KICKS buybacks**, **grants**.

Value loop (Frax‑style): **volume ↑ → fees ↑ → insurance & buybacks ↑ → KICKS value ↑ → more emissions & liquidity → volume ↑**.

* * *

11\. Listings & Risk Parameters
-------------------------------

### 11.1 SKU Eligibility

*   Minimum historical trade count and volume across sources.
*   Clear naming and SPID mapping (brand/model/colorway/year/DS).
*   Oracle integrity checks (redundant sources available).

### 11.2 Parameter Set per SKU  $i$ 

*    $IMR_i, MMR_i$ , max leverage  $L^{\max}_i$ .
*   Funding  $\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i, \Delta_f$ .
*   Price bands  $b_{\max}$ ; half‑life  $h$ ; staleness  $T_{\text{stale}}$ .
*   OI caps  $\text{OI}^{\max}_i$  and **skew caps**  $\sigma^{\max}_i$ .
*   Liquidation penalty  $\phi_i$ .
*   Circuit breaker sensitivity (halt after a price move > X% with oracle disagreement).

* * *

12\. State & Transitions (Sketch)
---------------------------------

### 12.1 Account State

For account  $a$ :

*   Balances:  $\text{bal}^{\text{sNEAK}}_a$ 
*   Positions:  $\{ Q_{a,i}, \text{entry}_{a,i} \}$ 
*   Equity:  $E_a$ 

### 12.2 Transitions

**(1) Trade Execution**

*   Match  $\Delta Q_{a,i}$  at execution price  $X$ .
*   Update  $Q_{a,i} \leftarrow Q_{a,i} + \Delta Q$ .
*   Realize PnL on closed portion; fees debit; adjust entry (VWAP) on open remainder.

**(2) Funding Event (each  $\Delta_f$ )**

*   Compute  $f_i$ .
*   Debit/credit  $Q_{a,i} \cdot M_i \cdot f_i$  in sNEAK.

**(3) Oracle Update**

*   Update  $P_i$  via §5; recompute  $M_i$ .

**(4) Risk Check**

*   If  $E_a < \sum_i MMR_i \cdot |Q_{a,i}| \cdot M_i$  → mark **liquidatable**.

**(5) Liquidation**

*   Close portion/all at bankruptcy price subject to bands; apply  $\phi_i$ .
*   Route residual losses to **insurance**, then **ADL** if needed.

* * *

13\. Market Imbalances & Controls
---------------------------------

*   **Dynamic Funding (skew term):** explicitly prices imbalances.
*   **Skew‑aware maker incentives:** extra maker rebates when quoting the minority side.
*   **OI/Skew caps:** reject new positions that worsen skew beyond  $\sigma^{\max}_i$ .
*   **Per‑market emissions:** veKICKS gauges direct incentives to one‑sided markets until balanced.
*   **Inventory‑aware vault quoting:** vault widens and reduces size as internal skew grows.

* * *

14\. Security, Audits, and Monitoring
-------------------------------------

*   **Formal verification** of funding and liquidation math.
*   **Invariant tests:** insurance solvency, margin monotonicity, no free‑lunch via funding loops.
*   **Oracle canary dashboard:** per‑source deviations, staleness warnings, quorum health.
*   **Kill switches:** market‑level and global.
*   **Bug bounties** and staged limits (caps) through alpha/beta.

* * *

15\. Governance
---------------

*   **veKICKS** locking (e.g., up to 4 years) → voting power.
*   **Gauges** allocate KICKS emissions to markets and LP Vaults.
*   **Parameter changes** gated by timelocks; emergency multisig only for pauses.
*   **Listing/removal** of SKUs via proposal with oracle readiness proof.
*   **CR policy** for sNEAK adjustable via on‑chain controller with constraints.

* * *

16\. Example End‑to‑End Flow (Numerical)
----------------------------------------

1.  **User deposits** $1,000 sNEAK; opens **long** on J1‑Chicago at  $M = \$400$  with **5×** leverage.
    *   Notional  $N = 1{,}000 \times 5 = \$5{,}000$ .
*   Suppose  $IMR = 10\%$ :  $\text{IM} = 0.10 \times 5{,}000 = \$500$  (meets).
*    $MMR = 6\%$ :  $\text{MM} = 0.06 \times 5{,}000 = \$300$ .
    2.  **Price rises** to  $M = \$420$ :
    *   uPnL  $= Q \cdot (420 - 400)$ . With notional $5,000 at entry $400,  $Q = 5{,}000/400 = 12.5$  contracts.
*   uPnL  $= 12.5 \times 20 = 250$ . Equity  $E$  increases by $250 minus funding/fees.
    3.  **Funding** (hourly) as in §6.2 applies. If longs pay  $0.05\%$  hourly:
    *   Payment  $= 0.0005 \times 5{,}000 = \$2.50$  per hour, debited from equity.
    4.  If price **drops** rapidly to  $M = \$370$ :
    *   uPnL  $= 12.5 \times (-30) = -375$ .
*   If equity  $E$  falls below  $\$300$ , liquidation triggers.

* * *

17\. Rollout Plan (Phased)
--------------------------

*   **Phase 0 (Testnet/Closed Beta):** 1–2 SKUs with synthetic oracle, hard caps, no ADL.
*   **Phase 1 (Guarded Mainnet):** Add real oracle, insurance funded, conservative limits, MM contracts.
*   **Phase 2 (Scale):** Expand SKUs, enable gauge voting, introduce vault backstop quoting.
*   **Phase 3 (Maturity):** Broaden collateral support, cross‑margin across cultural assets (cards, collectibles).

* * *

18\. Parameter Starting Points (Illustrative)
---------------------------------------------

| Parameter | Tier A SKU (iconic, liquid) | Tier B SKU (mid‑liquidity) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  $IMR$  | 10% | 15% |
|  $MMR$  | 6% | 10% |
|  $\alpha$  (basis/day) | 0.30 | 0.45 |
|  $\beta$  (skew/day) | 0.10 | 0.20 |
|  $\gamma$  (cap/day) | 0.25 | 0.35 |
| Funding interval  $\Delta_f$  | 1h | 1h |
| Oracle half‑life  $h$  | 12h | 18h |
| Staleness  $T_{\text{stale}}$  | 3h | 2h |
| OI cap (as % of vault equity) | 400% | 250% |
| Liquidation fee  $\phi$  | 0.75% | 1.25% |

_(These are placeholders; calibrate via historical sneaker volatility and Monte Carlo stress.)_

* * *

19\. Risks & Mitigations
------------------------

*   **Oracle Manipulation:** multi‑source, trimmed aggregation, bands, optimistic disputes.
*   **One‑Sided Hype:** skew term in funding, OI caps, targeted incentives, MM agreements.
*   **Peg Risk (sNEAK):** high CR, dynamic CR controller, redemption windows, buyback reserves.
*   **Liquidity Crises:** insurance fund sizing, staged leverage, circuit breakers, ADL as last resort.
*   **Legal/Regulatory:** jurisdictional compliance review, access controls where necessary.

* * *

20\. Open Research Questions
----------------------------

1.  **Size normalization:** whether to normalize DS prices by common sizes to reduce index noise.
2.  **Reseller hedging UX:** direct bridge for inventory hedges (proof‑of‑inventory → fee discounts?).
3.  **Volatility surface:** SKU‑specific vol and tail behavior for margin calibration.
4.  **Vault design:** single omnivault vs per‑SKU tranches for clearer risk/return.
5.  **Cross‑asset contagion:** correlation spikes across hyped drops and systemic risk.

* * *

21\. Conclusion
---------------

SPEX specifies a perp exchange tailored to sneaker assets, marrying **dYdX’s proven derivatives mechanics** with **Frax‑style capital efficiency and incentive alignment**. Robust oracles, conservative risk management, and an incentive flywheel targeting imbalanced markets are central to resilience. The system is designed to be rolled out conservatively, with tight caps and observable guardrails, before scaling to broader cultural assets.

### Appendix B — Example Oracle Weighting

For sources with trade counts  $n = \{n_1, n_2, \dots\}$  and reliability  $r$ , set

$$
w_s = \frac{\log(1+n_s)\, r_s}{\sum_u \log(1+n_u)\, r_u}
$$

then compute  $P^\* = \sum w_s m_{s,i}$ .

What’s inside & how to use each visual
--------------------------------------

### 1) **System Architecture (High Level)**

Shows how **Traders, Market Makers, and Resellers** interact with the **Perpetuals Engine**, how the **Oracle (SPI)** feeds prices, where **LP Vaults** backstop liquidity, and how **Insurance** and **Governance (veKICKS)** tie the whole loop together.  
**Use:** “What is SPEX?” slide or solution overview.

### 2) **Value Flywheel**

The growth loop: **Volume → Fees → Insurance & KICKS buybacks → veKICKS votes → Emissions to LPs/MMs → Deeper liquidity → Better pricing/UX → More volume.**  
**Use:** Investor narrative on sustainability & network effects.

### 3) **Perpetuals Mechanics (Funding & Index)**

Step‑by‑step from **resale data sources → cleaning → SPI (Pᵢ) → Mark price (Mᵢ) → Funding fᵢ** with inputs from **order book** and **OI skew**.  
**Use:** Technical diligence conversations with exchanges, DeFi teams, or risk committees.

### 4) **Liquidity Bootstrapping**

How we seed and balance markets: **Pro MMs, LP Vaults, Resellers (hedgers), Protocol Treasury**, plus **token incentives** feeding the **Perp Markets**.  
**Use:** Discussions with potential market makers, LPs, and launch partners.

### 5) **Risk Layers (Defense‑in‑Depth)**

Stacked controls from **Oracle integrity** up through **Margining**, **Liquidations**, **Insurance**, **ADL**, and **Circuit Breakers**.  
**Use:** Risk & compliance sections of the deck.

### 6) **Rollout Roadmap**

Phase‑based plan from **Closed Beta → Guarded Mainnet → Scale → Maturity** with key milestones.  
**Use:** Go‑to‑market & milestones slide.

### 7) **Token Model (sNEAK & KICKS)**

How **sNEAK** (settlement, CR policy) and **KICKS** (governance, veKICKS gauges) route **fees, buybacks, emissions**, and **insurance** to support **LP Vaults & Markets**.  
**Use:** Tokenomics overview for ecosystem partners and token investors.

Want it tailored?
-----------------

I can quickly customize:

*   **Your brand** (logo, fonts, color palette, taglines).
*   **Chain specifics** (NEAR/L2/appchain), oracle providers, and initial SKU(s).
*   **Parameter highlights** (IMR/MMR, funding bands, OI caps) for diligence.
*   **Go‑to‑market** callouts for sneaker partners, MMs, and LP programs.

If you share branding guidelines (logo, hex codes, fonts) and your preferred **first SKU(s)**, I’ll regenerate a branded deck and export to **PowerPoint** or **Keynote‑friendly PDFs**.

## Prompt:
Are there any gaps in our mechanics design for a perps focused on sneakers.  Ie should we barrow any other mechanics from say a curve or solidly type defi  primitives.  Would adding soulbound tokens add value?

## Response:
Thought for 41s

We’re thinking about gaps in sneaker perp mechanics. Borrowing elements from Curve and Solidly DeFi primitives could help. The use of soulbound tokens (SBTs) needs careful consideration. There are important risks to address, like oracle trust, index manipulation, and illiquidity issues. We can explore new mechanics like bribes, vote-escrow tokens, and dual-liquidity models as well.

The question is about borrowing from Curve or Solidly. We could consider using ve(3,3) with LP NFTs, dynamic emissions, and bribes. Additionally, soulbound tokens (SBTs) might help with KYC-lite, reseller verification, liquidation priority, and incentivizing verified resellers. However, SBT adoption risks need to be considered compared to decentralization principles, especially regarding privacy and regulation.

We’re borrowing ideas like Solidly’s ve(3,3) for bribes and a gauge that controls token emissions. A bonding mechanism, Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL), and risk-weighting models like Synthetix’s Perps v2 will also be considered. Hedgers could be incentivized with discounts for proof-of-inventory, ensuring legitimate claims using tools like receipts or NFTs for verification.

We need to consider risks like potential oracle manipulation, especially during drop-day spikes. To avoid this, volume thresholds, resilient aggregators, and influence limits per source can help. For sneaker markets, we might introduce “drop-day mode” or price discovery auctions. We can borrow from Curve’s stableswap design for liquidity, and propose dynamic emissions and bribes to optimize market activity.

Done

Great question. Short answer: your core design is solid, but there are a few **sneaker-specific gaps** to close and several **DeFi primitives worth borrowing** (Curve/veCRV, Solidly/ve(3,3), POL/bonding, Dutch backstop auctions). SBTs can help with _reseller verification & incentives_, but shouldn’t sit in the trading critical path.

* * *

What’s missing (sneaker-specific gaps)
======================================

1.  **Oracle microstructure (DS, size, venue bias)**
    *   Normalize for **deadstock** only and a **size band** (e.g., US 8–12) or publish a size-weighted curve.
*   Per-source **influence caps** + min trades/venue and a **TWAP lookback** to blunt one-off prints.
*   “**Oracle disagreement**” circuit breaker: if max(source) / min(source) > threshold → freeze funding & lower leverage until consensus returns.
    2.  **Launch/Drop-day mode**
    *   For the first 24–48h after a major drop: higher IMR/MMR, lower max leverage, tighter OI caps, higher funding cap γ, and optional **opening auction** before continuous trading.
    3.  **Skew & funding pathologies**
    *   Keep your skew term, but add:
    *   **Asymmetric funding** (charge the crowded side more than the minority gets credited).
    *   **Funding rate ladder** (piecewise schedule that steepens beyond a skew threshold).
    *   **Per-market dynamic taker fees** that rise with skew.
        4.  **Insurance sizing & recap path**
    *   Formalize target **SCR** (solvency coverage ratio): insurance ≥ k × (95–99% VaR of system net short gamma).
*   If breached, trigger **backstop Dutch auction** of KICKS or **OI throttling** until refilled.
    5.  **Hedger UX (your native advantage)**
    *   One-click “**Inventory Hedge**”: reseller enters pairs held → system suggests a perp short size.
*   Fee tiering for verified hedgers; optional delayed settlement windows to smooth funding spikes.
    6.  **Cross-SKU contagion**
    *   Correlation-aware portfolio margin (Tier A/B/C SKUs); cap global OI when multiple hyped SKUs move together.

* * *

What to borrow (Curve / Solidly & friends)
==========================================

A) Curve-style peg + gauges (for sNEAK)
---------------------------------------

*   **StableSwap pool for sNEAK/USDC** to harden the peg.
*   **Fee share to veKICKS voters** on that pool (like admin fees to veCRV), aligning incentives to keep the peg tight.
*   **AMO-style operations** (inspired by Frax): treasury policy executes mint/redeem & market ops within guardrails to defend peg without governance round-trips.

B) ve(3,3) emissions (Solidly pattern)
--------------------------------------

*   **Lock KICKS → veKICKS**; weekly emissions routed to **market gauges** (each SKU = a pair).
*   **Voters receive fees** from the markets they boost + can accept **external bribes** from MMs/resellers who want depth on specific SKUs.
*   Emissions **decay** over time; protocol controls base rate to avoid runaway dilution.

C) Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) / bonding
-------------------------------------------

*   Bond KICKS<->sNEAK or KICKS<->USDC LP tokens to the treasury (Olympus-style) so you **own** depth in the peg pool and can support backstop quotes when MMs step away.

D) Backstop auctions (Maker-style)
----------------------------------

*   If insurance is tapped, run **Dutch auctions** for KICKS or for future fee rights to recapitalize quickly and transparently.

E) TWAMM for buybacks
---------------------

*   Execute **time-weighted buybacks** (TWAMM) for KICKS using a portion of fees to minimize MEV and slippage.

F) RFQ + JIT liquidity
----------------------

*   Add an **RFQ lane** for block trades; allow “**just-in-time makers**” to fill skew without parking inventory on the book.

* * *

Should we add Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)?
======================================

**Value:**

*   **Verified Reseller SBT**: Attested by partners (marketplaces, boutiques). Grants _hedger fee tier_, higher borrow caps, or funding credits when shorting the SKU they stock.
*   **MM Accreditation SBT**: Whitelists professional MMs for maker rebates and quotes beyond public limits.
*   **Compliance/Access**: If you need gated access in some regions, SBTs can encode KYC attestations without storing raw data with you.
*   **Reputation**: Non-transferable badges for consistent positive funding provision, honest oracle disputes, or bug bounties.

**Caveats:**

*   Keep SBTs **optional**; don’t gate core trading or collateral behind them.
*   Use **expiring/refreshable attestations** (e.g., 6–12 months) to avoid stale status.
*   Minimize data: store _that_ an attestation exists and its issuer—not personal info.

**Bottom line:** Useful for _incentives and trust tiers_, not required for baseline market mechanics.

* * *

Concrete upgrades to your spec (actionable)
===========================================

1.  **Peg & Liquidity**
    *   Launch sNEAK/USDC **StableSwap** pool; route a slice of fees to **veKICKS voters**.
    *   Stand up **AMO policy** + **POL** to own part of this pool.
2.  **Emissions & Balance**
    *   Ship **ve(3,3) gauges** per SKU; let MMs/resellers **bribe** to direct emissions where depth is needed.
    *   Add **asymmetric funding** + **dynamic taker fees** tied to skew.
3.  **Risk & Backstops**
    *   Codify **SCR target** + **Dutch recap auctions**; publish dashboard.
    *   **Drop-day mode** with temporary leverage/OI clamps and an optional **opening auction**.
4.  **Oracle Hardening**
    *   DS-only filter, size curve normalization, min-trades per venue, **influence caps**, and **disagreement breaker**.
5.  **Hedger Program**
    *   Pilot a **Reseller SBT** with 1–2 trusted partners; fee discounts/funding credits on qualified hedges; inventory attestation flow.

* * *

Quick checklist (founder-level)
-------------------------------

*    sNEAK Curve pool live + AMO guardrails
*    veKICKS gauges/emissions + bribe UI
*    Asymmetric funding + dynamic taker fees + skew caps
*    Insurance SCR policy + Dutch auction backstop
*    Drop-day mode + opening auction switch
*    Oracle: DS/size filters, per-source caps, dispute window
*    Reseller SBT pilot + hedger UX

If you want, I can fold these into the deck I made (one slide per upgrade) and add a one-page **risk policy** summary with the SCR formula and drop-day parameters.

## Prompt:
What's the value to the sneaker head here.  They could just buy the Jordans for the same amount of money.  Take a pessimistic perspective to challenge the platform

## Response:
This is a sharp and important challenge — and the kind of skepticism an investor, sneakerhead, or regulator will hit you with right away. Let’s take a **pessimistic perspective** and unpack why a sneakerhead might **not** see value, and what that means for your platform.

* * *

🚫 Pessimistic View: Why Buy Perps Instead of Jordans?
======================================================

### 1\. **No Tangible Asset**

*   **Sneakerhead POV:** _“If I’m dropping $400, why would I put it into some abstract contract when I could just own the Jordans, flex them, wear them, or resell them?”_
*   Sneakers have **emotional, cultural, and aesthetic value**. A perp is financial exposure only — no flex, no collection, no physical enjoyment.

### 2\. **Liquidity vs. Culture**

*   In practice, sneakerheads trade shoes for both **profit and status**. Owning real pairs confers **clout** in the community.
*   A perp doesn’t show up on your feet, your IG, or your display case.
*   Without the cultural signaling, many sneakerheads see it as **“empty finance.”**

### 3\. **Accessibility Paradox**

*   One argument for perps is accessibility: anyone can get exposure without winning a raffle or hunting resell pairs.
*   But sneakerheads might counter: _“If I can’t cop, I’ll just move to the next pair. Why would I gamble on a sneaker’s price I don’t even own?”_

### 4\. **Skepticism of Oracles**

*   If your index is derived from StockX, GOAT, eBay, etc., sneakerheads will ask: _“What if prices are manipulated? What if bots wash trade on StockX to pump or crash the perp?”_
*   Thin liquidity in real resale markets creates **credibility risk** for your synthetic one.

### 5\. **Regulatory Red Flags**

*   To a casual sneakerhead, this can feel **too close to gambling**. _“I’m not a trader, I’m a collector. Why would I risk being rugged, liquidated, or dealing with regulators?”_

### 6\. **Complexity Barrier**

*   Sneakerheads know raffles, Discord cook groups, proxies, flipping pairs. They don’t know:
    *   Funding rates, liquidation ratios, skew caps, margin requirements.
*   A perp platform looks **intimidating and alien** compared to buying/selling shoes.

### 7\. **“Why Not Just Trade Crypto?”**

*   The skeptical angle: _“If I want leverage and perps, why not just trade ETH or SOL? At least those markets are liquid and global. Why trade a thin Jordan market with higher risks?”_
*   Competing with crypto-native perps is brutal unless the sneaker hook is truly sticky.

* * *

🎯 Implications for You as Founder
==================================

From this pessimistic lens, your challenge is to prove that **a sneaker perp offers unique value that buying Jordans (or trading ETH) doesn’t.**  
If you can’t answer this, the project risks being dismissed as a **niche DeFi toy**.

* * *

🔑 Counter-Moves (How You’d Address Skepticism)
===============================================

1.  **Accessibility + Leverage**
    *   Buying 1 pair = $400 locked.
    *   Perps let you get exposure with **$50 margin** → cheaper way to play sneaker price moves.
2.  **Hedging Use Case**
    *   Resellers actually _need_ this: if you’re sitting on 100 pairs, you don’t want to dump inventory. You short the perp to hedge price risk.
    *   This is where **real value lives**, even if casual sneakerheads don’t get it.
3.  **Social Layer**
    *   Without clout, sneakerheads won’t come. You need **gamification & culture**:
        *   Leaderboards (“Top Jordan Bulls of the Month”).
        *   Badges for trading specific SKUs.
        *   Tie-ins with real sneaker giveaways.
4.  **Lower Friction Than Owning**
    *   No shipping, no storage, no authentication, no fees from StockX/GOAT. Just pure exposure.
5.  **Expand Beyond Sneakerheads**
    *   The actual market might not be sneakerheads — but **crypto traders who want new exotic perps**. Sneaker perps can be pitched as “the first perp market on culture assets.”

* * *

✅ **Bottom line from the pessimistic take:**  
For _pure sneakerheads_, the platform risks feeling redundant (“why not just buy the shoes?”). The **real user base** may be:

*   Resellers (hedging).
*   Speculators (leveraged sneaker price exposure).
*   Crypto degens (exotic perp product).

If you want sneakerheads themselves, you need **cultural hooks** — otherwise, this stays a **finance product with sneaker branding**.

* * *

Do you want me to play devil’s advocate even harder — and sketch out a **worst-case scenario** where this fails to get traction (e.g., no liquidity, sneakerheads don’t care, regulators shut it down) — so you can bulletproof your pitch against those criticisms?

## Prompt:
Yes and is this even worth pursuing.  What value is this adding or creating?

## Response:
Excellent — let’s not sugarcoat. Let’s run a **worst-case analysis** and really ask: _is this worth pursuing? what value are we creating, and for whom?_

* * *

🚨 Worst-Case Scenario: How This Could Fail
===========================================

### 1\. **No Real Demand from Sneakerheads**

*   **Problem:** Sneakerheads want _the sneakers_, not financial exposure.
*   Owning the real shoe brings **status, flex, community, and optional resale profit**. A perp only gives price exposure with none of that.
*   Risk: sneakerheads dismiss this as **“finance cosplay of sneakers.”**

### 2\. **Thin & Manipulable Oracles**

*   Sneaker resale markets are **small, illiquid, and fragmented**.
*   A few spoof trades on StockX or eBay could distort your index.
*   Traders will see it as **easily gameable → untrustworthy**.
*   If the oracle isn’t bulletproof, the entire system collapses.

### 3\. **Liquidity Death Spiral**

*   To work, perps need constant two-sided liquidity.
*   If everyone piles long on a hyped shoe, shorts disappear → funding blows up → no one wants to trade → volume dies → LPs pull out → system collapses.
*   Without _serious_ MM incentives, this can happen fast.

### 4\. **Regulatory Blowback**

*   To a regulator, this looks like **offshore derivatives gambling** on cultural products.
*   You can’t frame it as just “sneaker markets” — it’s a **synthetic financial derivative**, which is tightly regulated.
*   Risk: shut out of US market, app stores, payment rails.

### 5\. **Better Alternatives Exist**

*   Sneaker flippers already hedge by:
    *   Diversifying across SKUs.
    *   Offloading inventory quickly.
    *   Using sneaker-backed lending platforms (Kikikix, Rares, etc.).
*   A perp adds complexity without clear superiority.

### 6\. **Crypto Trader Skepticism**

*   Crypto degens might play with exotic perps for a while…
*   But if liquidity is thin, or funding gets weird, they’ll abandon for ETH/BNB/PEPE perps which are deep and predictable.
*   You risk being seen as a **low-liquidity casino with niche branding.**

* * *

🔎 So… Is This Worth Pursuing?
==============================

Let’s be brutally honest:

### ❌ **For sneakerheads?**

*   **Low value add.** They want shoes, clout, and community.
*   Perps don’t deliver cultural utility.

### ❌ **For general DeFi users?**

*   **Moderate novelty, weak moat.** They can trade perps on anything (crypto, forex, commodities). Sneakers are exotic, but thin, and not scalable.

### ✅ **For resellers / sneaker shops?**

*   **Real utility.** They sit on thousands of pairs and would love a way to hedge inventory value without dumping shoes.
*   They are your most natural “anchor” users.

### ✅ **For investors / ecosystem partners?**

*   **Narrative appeal.** It’s the first “culture perp.” Even if it’s not mass-market, it’s a good **showcase of how DeFi primitives can reach new asset classes.**
*   Could spin into **sports cards, collectibles, NFTs, luxury goods.**

* * *

⚖️ Value Created (If Any)
=========================

1.  **Financialization of Cultural Assets**
    *   Creates a new asset class: exposure to Jordans without owning them.
    *   Bridges **sneaker resell economy (~$10B)** with DeFi infrastructure.
2.  **Hedging Tool for Resellers**
    *   The _one true functional use case_: resellers can short perps to lock in profit on inventory.
    *   If you can capture even a sliver of this market, that’s defensible.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept for Broader Expansion**
    *   Sneakers are your wedge, but the bigger vision is **perps on any collectible**: watches, trading cards, luxury bags.
    *   Investors may back this as a **template**, not a sneaker-only play.

* * *

🧭 My Recommendation
====================

*   If your vision is **“a sneakerhead app”**, I’d say **don’t pursue** — the cultural/utility gap is too wide.
*   If your vision is **“a DeFi derivatives platform for cultural assets, starting with sneakers”**, then it’s worth pursuing as a **category experiment**.

That means your pitch shifts:

*   Not “sneakerheads will trade perps” → (unlikely).
*   Instead: “resellers hedge, degens speculate, and we prove cultural assets can be financialized like commodities.”

* * *

✅ **Bottom line:** It’s worth pursuing only if you’re thinking **bigger than sneakers.** Sneakers are just the **Trojan horse** to build infra for culture-perps.

* * *

Do you want me to **draft the positioning narrative** you’d use with investors, where you acknowledge these risks head-on but frame sneakers as your wedge into a bigger collectible-finance vision?

## Prompt:
That's actually the route I'm taking which is sneakers are the wedge

## Response:
Perfect — then you’re thinking about this the right way. If **sneakers are the wedge**, you’re not building “a sneaker perp casino.” You’re building **the first derivatives exchange for culture assets**, and sneakers just happen to be the most _recognizable, liquid, and hype-driven_ entry point.

Here’s how I’d structure the narrative for **investors, partners, and ecosystem teams**:

* * *

🎯 1. Problem Statement (The Cultural Assets Economy)
-----------------------------------------------------

*   The global **sneaker resale market is ~$10B today** and growing fast.
*   Expanding beyond sneakers: trading cards, luxury handbags, collectibles, even digital culture (NFTs). Together, this is a **$300B+ alternative assets market**.
*   Problem: **no financial infrastructure**. Collectors and resellers can’t easily hedge, get leverage, or short these assets.
*   They’re stuck with physical logistics, illiquidity, and huge transaction fees (StockX/GOAT take ~10%).

* * *

🚀 2. Sneakers as the Wedge
---------------------------

*   Sneakers are the most **culturally iconic, globally recognized, and data-rich** collectible class.
*   Resale markets are already **digitized** (StockX, GOAT, eBay APIs).
*   Community is **speculative by nature**: “will these go up or down?” is already part of the sneakerhead mindset.
*   This makes them the **perfect sandbox** to test perpetual futures for culture.

* * *

⚙️ 3. SPEX: Perpetuals for Culture Assets
-----------------------------------------

*   **Perp Mechanics (dYdX-style):** margin, funding, liquidations, insurance.
*   **Capital Efficiency (Frax-style):** partially collateralized stable (sNEAK) + governance token (KICKS) to direct liquidity.
*   **Oracle Layer:** robust Sneaker Price Index (SPI) from multiple resale venues.
*   **Liquidity Bootstrapping:** pro MMs + reseller hedgers + LP vaults.

* * *

🛡️ 4. Why This Creates Real Value
----------------------------------

### For Resellers / Shops

*   Hedge 100 pairs in inventory without fire-selling.
*   Lock in profits while staying long physical pairs.

### For Traders / Degens

*   First chance to **long/short culture assets** with leverage.
*   Exotic perps as the next trading frontier beyond BTC/ETH.

### For Sneakerheads (longer-term)

*   Participate in price action **without buying/holding pairs**.
*   Gamified markets, badges, sneaker-themed competitions.

### For Investors

*   Sneakers are the wedge → **expansion to cards, watches, luxury, NFTs**.
*   SPEX = the **CME of culture**.

* * *

📈 5. Expansion Roadmap
-----------------------

1.  **Phase 1:** Sneakers (Jordans, Yeezys, Dunks). Build liquidity, hedge utility, prove oracle model.
2.  **Phase 2:** Expand to **trading cards** (Pokémon, NBA Top Shot), **luxury watches** (Rolex, AP).
3.  **Phase 3:** **Other collectibles + NFTs** → an all-in-one exchange for culture assets.
4.  **Endgame:** A **new derivatives category** where culture is financialized like commodities.

* * *

⚖️ 6. The Hedge to Criticism
----------------------------

*   **Why not just buy the shoes?**  
    → You can’t get leverage, shorting, or hedge exposure by buying shoes.
*   **Why sneakers first?**  
    → Clear data, liquid resale, cultural reach. They’re the _gateway_ asset.
*   **Isn’t this too niche?**  
    → Sneakers are the beachhead. The bigger market is **all collectibles**.

* * *

🔑 Investor Hook:
-----------------

“This is not about sneakers. Sneakers are our **Bitcoin moment** — the first asset that proves the model. We’re building the derivatives rails for all culture.”

* * *

✅ With that positioning, the question is no longer “will sneakerheads trade perps?” It’s: **can you execute the wedge strategy, get early liquidity, and expand fast enough into adjacent cultural assets?**

* * *

Would you like me to **draft an investor pitch deck outline** (10–12 slides) using this wedge-to-platform narrative, so you can plug in the visuals we already generated?

## Prompt:
I have an idea what if we pivot to NBA top shot, because Flo blockchain already has and nBA trading cards as NFTs. Could we create perps on the nft trading cards

## Response:
Yes 👌 — pivoting to **NBA Top Shot and NFT trading cards** actually makes _a lot_ of sense, and might solve some of the biggest gaps in the sneaker-perps idea. Let’s break it down:

* * *

🏀 Why NBA Top Shot (and NFT trading cards) Make More Sense Than Sneakers
=========================================================================

### 1\. **On-Chain Market Data**

*   Unlike sneakers (fragmented resale across StockX, GOAT, eBay), Top Shot sales are already **on-chain** (Flow blockchain).
*   This means you can build **robust, transparent oracles** directly from on-chain NFT sales, with fewer manipulation risks.

### 2\. **Digital-Native Community**

*   NBA Top Shot users are already **crypto-native or crypto-adjacent**.
*   They understand wallets, tokens, marketplaces — fewer education hurdles compared to sneakerheads.

### 3\. **Liquidity & Price Discovery**

*   Certain Top Shot moments are heavily traded with public sales data.
*   Unlike physical assets, no shipping, condition disputes, or authenticity issues.

### 4\. **Clearer Expansion Path**

*   If you crack perps on Top Shot, you can quickly expand to:
    *   Other NFT cards (Sorare, Gods Unchained).
    *   NFT PFPs (BAYC, Azuki).
    *   Digital collectibles (gaming skins, digital tickets).
*   This ties neatly into the **bigger wedge story: perps for culture assets**.

* * *

⚙️ Mechanics of NFT Trading Card Perps
======================================

1.  **Index Price (Oracle)**
    *   Instead of a sneaker resale index, use **floor price or average sales price** of a given NFT collection (e.g., “LeBron James Cosmic Dunk”).
    *   Oracles can pull directly from Flow’s marketplace contract or aggregator APIs.
    *   Smoothing (7-day VWAP) to avoid single-sale spikes.
2.  **Perp Contract**
    *   Same mechanics as dYdX:
        *   Traders deposit USDC (or stable).
        *   Go long/short perp on “LeBron Cosmic Dunk floor price.”
        *   Funding rate balances perp vs. oracle.
3.  **Market Listings**
    *   Start with the **top 5–10 most liquid Top Shot moments**.
    *   Expand into **sets or indexes** (e.g., “Top 10 Legendary Cards” = basket oracle).
4.  **Liquidity Sources**
    *   NFT whales can hedge collections by shorting perps.
    *   Crypto degens can speculate with leverage without owning NFTs.
    *   LP vaults and market makers backstop liquidity.

* * *

⚖️ Value Creation in the NFT Pivot
==================================

### For **NFT Holders (Collectors)**

*   Hedge your bags — if you own 10 LeBron moments worth $100k, you can short the perp to lock in value.
*   Stay long culture + fandom while de-risking volatility.

### For **Speculators**

*   Trade **price exposure** without buying the NFT.
*   Use leverage (5–10x) and open both long & short positions.
*   Accessible: you don’t need $50k to play in legendary moments.

### For **Ecosystem Partners**

*   NBA/Flow already positioned as “NBA’s official digital collectibles.”
*   Perps layer adds **financial utility** → deeper engagement & volume.

### For **Investors**

*   Clear wedge into **NFT derivatives**, which is still an underserved category (most NFT financialization is just lending/borrowing).

* * *

🚨 Challenges to Flag (Pessimistic Lens)
========================================

1.  **Thin Liquidity**
    *   Even Top Shot’s secondary markets aren’t as deep as ETH or BTC.
    *   Oracles can still be manipulated with large buys/sells on illiquid cards.
2.  **Regulatory Overlap**
    *   Now you’re squarely in **NFT derivatives territory**, which regulators may view as **securities-linked gambling**.
    *   But: at least it’s digital-native, so messaging (“synthetic exposure to NFT prices”) is cleaner.
3.  **Community Fit**
    *   Top Shot users are collectors first. You’ll need to **frame this as hedging/protection**, not just degenerate gambling.
4.  **Technical Integration**
    *   If building on Flow, you need to integrate with their ecosystem — or settle perps elsewhere (EVM chain) with Flow oracles bridging in.

* * *

✅ Why This Pivot Could Be Strong
================================

*   **Cleaner data** → on-chain NFT sales easier to index than sneaker resales.
*   **Crypto-native audience** → NFT degens are already primed for leverage & speculation.
*   **Category leadership** → NFT derivatives are underdeveloped compared to spot + lending.
*   **Scalable beyond NBA** → cards are just the wedge; expansion to PFPs, art NFTs, gaming assets.

* * *

👉 If sneakers are “too physical, too cultural, not liquid enough,” then **NFT trading cards are digital, on-chain, liquid enough, and already financialized**. This pivot feels like it could make the platform more **credible and investable**.

* * *

Do you want me to sketch how a **Top Shot Perp Oracle** would work (step-by-step, from NFT sales → price index → perp contract)? That’s probably the crux for feasibility.

## Prompt:
Give me a few examples of this nft top shot perp. And do perps have contract expiry dates?

## Response:
Great questions 👌 — let’s get concrete with **examples of NBA Top Shot perps**, and clarify **how perpetuals differ from futures with expiries**.

* * *

🏀 Example: NBA Top Shot Perpetual Contracts
============================================

### 1\. **LeBron James — Cosmic Dunk (Legendary Moment)**

*   **Index price (oracle):** Floor price of the “Cosmic Dunk” set on Flow. Let’s say it’s **$25,000**.
*   **Perp market:**
    *   Trader A goes long $5k notional at 5x leverage → controlling $25k exposure with $5k margin.
    *   Trader B goes short the same notional, betting floor price will fall.
*   **Funding rate:**
    *   If perp trades above oracle price, longs pay shorts (and vice versa).
*   **Use case:**
    *   A whale holding 10 Cosmic Dunks worth $250k shorts the perp to hedge value.
    *   A speculator takes the other side, hoping LeBron hype drives prices up.

* * *

### 2\. **Steph Curry — 3-Point Record Moment (Rare)**

*   **Index price:** Average of last 20 sales, say **$3,200**.
*   **Perp market:**
    *   Retail trader longs $1k notional to bet it climbs after NBA playoffs.
    *   Another trader shorts, betting collectors will dump after hype fades.
*   **Funding:**
    *   If everyone piles long, funding flips positive → longs bleed small fees to shorts until balance is restored.

* * *

### 3\. **Top Shot “Series 1 Set Index”**

*   **Index price:** Basket of floor prices across all Series 1 commons (e.g., 50 moments).
*   **Perp market:**
    *   Functions like a cultural index future.
    *   Traders can long/short “the overall value of Series 1.”
*   **Use case:**
    *   Diversified exposure — less risk of one card being illiquid/manipulated.
    *   Easier for casuals: “bet on Series 1 overall,” not individual cards.

* * *

⏳ Do Perpetuals Have Expiry Dates?
==================================

**No — that’s the key difference.**

*   **Traditional futures** (like CME oil contracts):
    *   Have an expiry date (monthly/quarterly).
    *   At expiry, they settle to the underlying price.
*   **Perpetual futures (“perps”)**:
    *   **No expiry date** → positions can be held indefinitely.
    *   To keep perp prices aligned with the index, the **funding rate** is charged periodically (e.g., hourly, 8h).
    *   This is why they’re called “perpetuals.”

👉 In your case, an **NBA Top Shot perp never expires**.

*   Traders can hold exposure to LeBron Cosmic Dunk indefinitely, as long as they maintain margin.
*   The funding rate ensures perp price ≈ oracle price over time.

* * *

✅ Why Perps Fit NFTs Well
=========================

*   Collectibles don’t have natural “expiry events” like wheat harvests or oil delivery.
*   Continuous speculation (and hedging) makes more sense.
*   Traders don’t want to roll contracts every month — perps remove that friction.

* * *

⚡ Quick summary:

*   **Examples**: LeBron Legendary, Steph Curry Rare, Series 1 Index.
*   **Mechanics**: Same as crypto perps (funding balances long/short).
*   **Expiry**: No expiry — perps run forever, unlike futures.

* * *

Would you like me to sketch out a **launch playbook for NBA Top Shot perps** (which 3–5 markets you’d open first, how you’d seed liquidity, and how to pitch it to Flow/NBA ecosystem)?

## Prompt:
Let's get back to the sneaker version as the wedge.

## Response:
Got it 👍 — back to sneakers as the wedge. Let’s re-center on **why sneakers**, what the perp mechanics unlock in that context, and where you’d realistically deliver value before expanding into other cultural assets.

* * *

👟 Why Sneakers as the Wedge
============================

### 1\. **Massive Existing Market**

*   Sneaker resale is already a **$10B+ global market** (StockX, GOAT, eBay).
*   Prices are volatile, hype-driven, and culturally charged — perfect conditions for derivatives.

### 2\. **Speculative Culture**

*   Sneakerheads already talk in trading terms: “This pair will 2× after release,” “hold or flip?”
*   A perp is just a **financial formalization of behavior they already exhibit.**

### 3\. **Hedging Need**

*   Resellers sit on **real inventory** and face price risk.
*   Example: a shop holding 200 pairs of Jordan 4 “Military Black” at $300 retail. If market tanks to $200, that’s a $20k+ hit.
*   A perp lets them **short exposure** to lock in resale margins without dumping inventory.

### 4\. **Cultural Entry Point**

*   Sneakers are **recognizable** across mainstream investors, even those who don’t care about NFTs.
*   Easier wedge narrative than starting with more niche assets (like Pokémon cards).

* * *

⚙️ Sneaker Perp Mechanics (Simplified for Pitch)
================================================

*   **Oracle (Index Price):** Aggregated sneaker resale data (StockX, GOAT, Stadium Goods, eBay) → “Sneaker Price Index (SPI).”
*   **Perp Market:** Traders long/short sneaker SKUs (e.g., “Jordan 1 Retro High Chicago 2015”).
*   **Funding Rate:** Keeps perp price aligned with SPI — longs pay shorts when perp > index, and vice versa.
*   **No Expiry:** Traders can hold indefinitely (perpetuals never settle, unlike futures).

* * *

🛠️ Launch Strategy (Sneakers First)
====================================

### 1\. **Pick Anchor SKUs**

*   Jordan 1 Retro High “Chicago”
*   Jordan 4 “Military Black”
*   Yeezy 350 OG
*   Travis Scott collab (Nike or Jordan)  
    These are **liquid, culturally iconic, and data-rich**.

### 2\. **Seed Liquidity**

*   **Resellers:** Onboard 2–3 shops with real inventory, offer them fee discounts to hedge.
*   **Crypto Market Makers:** Partner with MMs (or incentivize via token emissions) to quote spreads.
*   **LP Vaults:** Let retail LPs deposit USDC to backstop trades in exchange for yield.

### 3\. **Target Users**

*   **Resellers:** Hedging inventory risk.
*   **Crypto Traders:** Exotic perps, cultural speculation.
*   **Sneaker Enthusiasts:** Gamified exposure without owning pairs.

### 4\. **Culture & Growth**

*   Sneakerhead marketing: trading competitions (“Top Jordan Bulls of the Month”).
*   Partnerships with sneaker influencers & Discord cook groups.
*   Sneaker-themed NFTs or badges for top traders (bridges culture + finance).

* * *

⚖️ Value Creation (Why This Matters)
====================================

*   **For Resellers:**  
    → First real **hedge instrument** for sneaker inventory.
*   **For Sneaker Enthusiasts:**  
    → **Price exposure** without $500+ upfront to buy a pair.  
    → Fun, gamified way to “bet on the hype.”
*   **For Traders/Investors:**  
    → First perp market on a **non-crypto cultural asset**.  
    → Expansion path into cards, watches, luxury goods.

* * *

🚨 Key Risks (that you must address early)
==========================================

1.  **Oracle Fragility** → Thin resale markets are gameable. Must build trust in SPI.
2.  **Liquidity Gaps** → Without strong MMs/LPs, markets can get one-sided and collapse.
3.  **Cultural Fit** → Hardcore sneakerheads may still prefer owning pairs. You need to wrap this in **status + gamification**.
4.  **Regulatory Optics** → Looks like a derivatives exchange → need offshore structure + careful messaging.

* * *

✅ So the wedge story looks like this:

*   **Phase 1 (Sneakers):** Launch perps on iconic Jordans/Yeezys. Prove oracles + hedging use case.
*   **Phase 2 (Expand):** Add other collectibles (cards, watches, luxury goods).
*   **Phase 3 (Platform):** SPEX becomes **the derivatives exchange for cultural assets**.

* * *

Would it help if I **mapped out the first 12 months as a milestone plan** (Month 0–3, 3–6, 6–12), showing exactly how to go from first sneaker perp launch → multi-asset cultural perps?

## Prompt:

👟 Sneaker Perps Value Map
==========================

| **User Segment** | **Their Current Pain / Motivation** | **Value SPEX Creates** | **Example Use Case** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Resellers / Sneaker Shops** | • Hold large inventories vulnerable to price drops.  
• Limited tools to hedge risk.  
• Must liquidate inventory in panic if market dips. | • **Hedging tool** → short perps to lock in resale margins.  
• **Capital efficiency** → hedge without selling physical pairs.  
• **Fee discounts & SBT badges** for verified resellers. | Shop holding 200 pairs of Jordan 4 “Military Black” shorts $60k notional perps to lock in value ahead of a flood of supply. |
| **Sneaker Enthusiasts (Non-Resellers)** | • Can’t always afford hyped pairs ($400+).  
• FOMO around hype drops.  
• Status/flex is tied to shoes they don’t own. | • **Affordable exposure** → trade sneaker price moves with $50 margin instead of $400 retail.  
• **Gamification** → leaderboards, sneaker badges, tournaments.  
• **Flex in new form** → “I was the top trader on Jordan 1 Chicago this month.” | A fan who can’t cop Jordan 1 “Chicago” goes long $100 notional and joins a sneaker trading competition. |
| **Crypto Traders / Degens** | • Always seeking new exotic perp markets.  
• Saturated with BTC/ETH/PEPE perps.  
• Want volatility & novelty. | • **New asset class** → cultural perps as high-beta playground.  
• **Leverage & funding plays** → exploit funding mispricings in thin markets.  
• **Token rewards** via veKICKS gauges. | Degen arbs funding between sneaker perps and crypto markets; farms KICKS incentives. |
| **Collectors / Sneaker Investors** | • Sit on grails but can’t monetize them until sale.  
• Worry about value erosion over time. | • **Liquidity without selling** → hedge grail holdings via shorts.  
• **Optional leverage** → amplify conviction plays.  
• **Portfolio view** → exposure across multiple SKUs. | Collector holding rare Jordans shorts sneaker perp to offset fear of hype cooling. |
| **Liquidity Providers / LP Vault Users** | • Want yield but not sneaker-native.  
• Lack easy entry into sneaker economy.  
• Don’t want to manually trade. | • **Yield on sneaker hype** → deposit USDC, earn fees + KICKS rewards.  
• **Passive exposure** without trading risk.  
• Optional vault tranches (low vs. high risk). | LP deposits $10k USDC, earns 20% APY from trading fees & funding residuals. |
| **Market Makers** | • Seek new venues to capture spreads.  
• Saturated with crypto perps. | • **New playground** with guaranteed incentives.  
• **Bribes via veKICKS gauges**.  
• Early mover advantage. | MM posts tight spreads on Jordan 4 market, collects maker rebates + bribes. |
| **Ecosystem Partners (Brands, Marketplaces)** | • Want engagement, volume, new revenue streams.  
• Struggle with retention & monetization. | • **New trading layer** on top of existing sneaker resale markets.  
• **Partnership revenues** (data, co-marketing).  
• Increased user stickiness. | StockX integrates SPI feed → gets cut of fees + traffic from perp traders. |
| **Investors** | • Looking for scalable, defensible wedge.  
• Want proof of real use beyond speculation. | • **Sneakers = wedge** → credible starting point.  
• **Expansion path** → cards, watches, luxury goods, NFTs.  
• **Category creation** → CME of culture. | Early investor backs sneaker wedge with eye on platform expansion. |

🔑 Insights
===========

1.  **Core “must-have” users** = **resellers & shops** (hedging utility is undeniable).
2.  **Growth engine** = **crypto traders/degenerates** (they’ll provide early liquidity & volume).
3.  **Cultural legitimacy** = **sneaker enthusiasts & collectors** (need gamification + status incentives).
4.  **Sustainability** = **LP vaults + MMs** (ensure depth & balance).
5.  **Narrative scale** = **ecosystem partners & investors** (platform story beyond sneakers).

* * *

✅ This shows **different value props for each segment**, which is critical when pitching. Sneakers aren’t the _endgame_ — but they give you **resellers to anchor liquidity, crypto traders to bootstrap volume, and culture to make it resonate.**

* * *

Do you want me to spin this into a **visual map (like a 2x2 or ecosystem diagram)** so you can literally show “here’s the value each group gets” in a single investor slide?
