### **Context**

- Developing a concept for a decentralized Monopoly game that combines AI and Web3 technology
- Initial inspiration came from managing two nephews wanting to play different versions of Monopoly simultaneously (classic vs themed)
- Goal is to create a customizable gaming experience while maintaining core Monopoly gameplay mechanics
- Seeking to avoid license violations or determine licensing requirements for Monopoly-based gameplay

### **Brainstorming**

- Core game mechanics
    - Multiple players can participate, each with their own customized board
    - Gameplay remains as similar as possible to traditional Monopoly
    - Each playerâ€™s board features unique pieces, designs, and visual elements
- AI integration for dynamic content generation
    - Large language models would generate all game pieces and artwork dynamically
    - Customization extends to currency representation for properties
    - System requires reserve currency mechanism for value exchange between different platforms
- Web3 and marketplace functionality
    - Players retain ownership of their generated game sets
    - Full marketplace ecosystem for lending, trading, and selling custom sets
    - Potential for lending market where players can borrow against their collections
    - Floor value establishment for sets could enable financial services
- Educational and financial exposure benefits
    - Provides players with financial education through gaming
    - Unique combination of AI and blockchain creates novel user experience for traditional gameplay

### **Decision**

- Start with Monopoly as the initial game offering
- Future roadmap would apply same logic to other traditional games
- Need to resolve licensing considerations before proceeding
- Focus on creating entirely customizable experience while preserving core gameplay mechanics
