# Security Model & Risk Management

## Purpose
This section establishes the comprehensive security model and risk management framework for the Decentralized Monopoly Platform, identifying potential threats across technical, economic, and operational domains while defining robust mitigation strategies that ensure platform integrity, user protection, and regulatory compliance.

## Scope
The security analysis covers threat modeling, risk assessment, security controls, monitoring protocols, and compliance frameworks that protect the platform's technical architecture, economic incentives, and operational integrity against identified attack vectors and operational risks.

## Core Security Principles

The Decentralized Monopoly Platform implements security based on four fundamental principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multi-layered security controls across AI, blockchain, economic, and operational domains
2. **Proactive Threat Modeling**: Comprehensive analysis of attack vectors before platform deployment and operation
3. **Incentive-Aligned Security**: Economic mechanisms that discourage malicious behavior through aligned incentives
4. **Transparent Risk Management**: Public risk assessments and mitigation strategies that build user trust and enable community oversight

## Threat Model Analysis

### Technical Threat Vectors
