# Yellow Paper Workplan: Decentralized Monopoly

## Project Overview
Coordinated development of a comprehensive yellow paper for the Decentralized Monopoly platform, combining AI-powered content generation with Web3 ownership mechanics.

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Section Lead (Primary Writer)
- Owns section drafts and integrates inputs from supporting research
- Accountable for coherence, adherence to style guide, and level-200 depth
- Coordinates with Editor for final section integration

### Supporting Research Agent
- Produces helper documents with curated sources, definitions, and key claims
- Proposes figures/tables with captions and technical specifications
- Conducts @Web research to validate and supplement ideation claims

### Editor/Integrator
- Harmonizes tone and resolves overlaps across sections
- Enforces taxonomy consistency and integrates approved sections into master document
- Final authority on style guide compliance and cross-references

### QA/Consistency Agent
- Runs duplication checks and validates citation completeness
- Confirms compliance with acceptance criteria and technical accuracy
- Updates taxonomy and maintains canonical term consistency

## Development Sequence & Cadence

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. **Abstract** - Executive summary and value proposition
2. **Introduction & Problem Statement** - Context and opportunity analysis

### Phase 2: Architecture (Week 3-4)
3. **Architecture Overview** - System components and data flows
4. **Protocol Mechanics** - On-chain/off-chain balance and smart contracts

### Phase 3: Economics & Security (Week 5-6)
5. **Economic Model** - Tokenomics, incentives, and marketplace design
6. **Security Model & Risk Management** - Threat models and mitigation

### Phase 4: Implementation & Future (Week 7-8)
7. **Governance, Compliance, and Legal Considerations** - Regulatory framework
8. **Implementation Notes** - Technical architecture and interoperability
9. **Roadmap & Milestones** - Development phases and future extensions

### Phase 5: Completion (Week 9-10)
10. **Glossary** - Canonical terms and definitions
11. **References** - Complete citation registry

## Weekly Cadence & Checkpoints
- **Monday**: Supporting Agent delivers helper document for active section
- **Wednesday**: Section Lead completes draft section
- **Friday**: Editor integrates and QA validates section
- **Bi-weekly**: Full team sync to review progress and resolve blockers

## Quality Gates
- **Helper Document**: Must include citations, definitions, proposed figures, and dependencies
- **Section Draft**: Must adhere to level-200 depth and use canonical terms
- **Integration**: Must pass duplication checks and style guide compliance
- **Final**: Must have cross-references and complete citations

## Success Metrics
- All sections completed within 10-week timeframe
- Zero duplication across sections (validated by QA)
- Consistent use of canonical terminology throughout
- All key claims supported by citations from reputable sources
- Figures and diagrams integrated with proper captions

## Risk Management
- **Technical Complexity**: AI-blockchain integration may require additional research time
- **Legal Uncertainty**: IP and licensing considerations may impact scope
- **Coordination Overhead**: Multi-agent workflow requires clear communication protocols
- **Scope Creep**: Level-200 constraint must be strictly enforced

## Communication Protocol
- All section discussions in dedicated PR comments
- Cross-section dependencies explicitly documented in helper docs
- Weekly progress updates shared across all agents
- Immediate notification for any blocking issues or scope changes
